         Write a function that does 1% sampling - this is to say the function returns true approx 1% of the time. Note that you want to keep that 1% truly random and spread out.
        This function could exist separately on different machines. Hence it could be initiated multiple times across machines.

        Note:- An error rate of 5% is allowed. No global variables should be used.

        For example, if the function is called 2000 times, it should ideally return true 20 times.
        Considering the error rate of 5%, the minimum number of times the function should return true is 20 - (5% of 20) = 19 and the maximum number of times the function should return true is 20 + (5% of 20) = 21.
        Hence, the code runs successfully if the function returns true 19, 20 or 21 times. In all other cases, it will give an error.
